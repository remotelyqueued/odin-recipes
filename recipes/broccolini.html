            Grill a simple vegetable like broccolini and layer up the flavors
            with an easy lemon tahini dressing, fresh pomegranate seeds, and
            toasted pine nuts. It's a side dish with major wow factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            It comes together in under 25 minutes (so quick!) and it looks (and
            tastes!) stunning bright colors, different textures, and a super
            creamy dressing. It all adds up to more than the sum of its parts.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 heaping tablespoons tahini</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>5 to 7 tablespoons (75 to 100 milliliters) ice cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons (50g) raw pine nuts</li>
            <li>14 ounces (400g) broccolini</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>
                1 cup fresh pomegranate arils, from 1 large ripe pomegranate
            </li>
            <li>A good handful of flat leaf parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Aleppo pepper flakes, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the dressing:</h3>
                <p>
                    In a medium bowl, add the tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.
                    Gradually drizzle in 5 tablespoons ice cold water, whisking
                    continuously to create a smooth, thin, and creamy dressing,
                    adding more water as needed. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each
                    salt and black pepper, stir well, and refrigerate until
                    ready to use. The dressing will keep for at least 3 days
                    covered and chilled in the fridge.

                <h3>Fire up the grill for direct grilling over high heat:</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>For a charcoal grill</strong>, light a small pile of
                    coals - a couple handfuls should be enough - you won't need much
                    if you are not grilling anything else. Place the lit coals
                    onto one half of the grill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>For a gas grill</strong>, turn on one burner to high
                    heat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Toast the pine nuts:</h3>
                <p>
                    Tip the pine nuts into a small fireproof pan-it shouldn't
                    have any plastic or wooden parts. Set it on the grill
                    directly over the fire. Toast for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
                    occasionally, until golden brown then transfer to a small
                    dish and set it aside. You can also do this on the stove top
                    over medium-high heat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Grill the broccolini:</h3>
                <p>
                    Place the broccolini in a large bowl, drizzle in the olive
                    oil, and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss to
                    evenly coat. Use tongs to rest the stems perpendicular to
                    the grill bars directly over the fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cook over a high heat for 8 to 10 minutes turning often
                    until lightly charred and tender but still with plenty of
                    bite. Every fire is different, so don't go by cook times but
                    by visual cues.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Dress and serve:</h3>
                <p>
                    Transfer the grilled broccolini onto a serving plate and
                    drizzle the dressing on top-it may need a good stir if it's
                    been sitting in the fridge for a while. Scatter the
                    pomegranate seeds, toasted pine nuts, parsley, and Aleppo
                    pepper flakes on top.Serve warm.
